# CSCI3002
This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Fundamentals of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at CU Boulder.

Overview of the Course  
The purpose of this course is to learn about, explore, and practice methods for conducting user-centered research, design, and user evaluation. You will learn about user-centered design practices by actually doing them, reflecting on how things went, and (inmost cases) practicing them several more times. You will learn about a variety of techniques for working with users andwill apply them in the context of real-world design projects.  

Learning Objectives:  
Upon the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
* Generate, discuss, and evaluate ideas for designing new interactive systems;
* Conduct user research in order to understand users' needs, abilities, challenges, and other attributes, in context;
* Develop and refine ideas through brainstorming, sketching, storyboarding, and creating low-fidelity, mid-, and high-fidelity prototypes;
* Evaluate prototypes through user testing and heuristic evaluation methods, and analyze the resulting data;
* Compare and contrast design, prototyping, user testing, and analysis methods in order to determine the right method for the problem you are trying to solve;
* Develop universally accessible technologies that address individuals with a wide range of needs and abilities.
